# data-representation-courseware
This repository contains all files relating to weekly assignments for Data Representation module.


## Assignment 1.1 Create an XML
### Exercise 1.1

- Create an XML file that stores data for a library.
- The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).
- Each catalogue can contain a number of books (say 2 for the purpose of this exercise).
- Books will have an ISBN, title and author.
- Upload your .xml file to your github repository called data-representation-courseware.



## Assignment 03
<p>Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json"</p>

- Upload this program to the same repository you used for the XML assignment
- Save this assignment as "assignment03-cso.py"
- This program should not be a long one
    - I don't need you to reformat or analyse the data in any way
    - It should be about 10ish lines long (I have not counted)
- You will need to find the dataset in CSO.ie, try economic and then finance.


## Assignment 04

- Write a program in python that will read a file from a repository.
- The program should then replace all the instances of the text "Andrew" with your name
- The program should then commit those changes and push the file back to the repository.

<p>I do not need to see your keys. Save the program as assignment04-github.py to the same repository you uploaded the xml too. Marks will be given for the functionality and layout of the code; I do expect minimal comments to indicate you know what the program is doing.</p>
